--- Map Accuracy Suggestions ---
To measure map accuracy, consider:
1. Ground truth comparison: Place markers at known positions,
   compare measured vs actual distances between them
2. Loop closure error: After returning to origin, check
   odometry drift (final_dist to origin should be ~0)
3. Feature alignment: Compare map walls to actual room layout
4. Consistency check: Run multiple times, overlay maps
5. Tape measure validation: Measure actual room dimensions,
   compare to map scale (resolution * pixels)
