Autonomous Scanning Mode for UGV Robot
Based on sector-based obstacle avoidance algorithm

Divides LiDAR scan into 12 sectors (30° each), finds clearest path,
and navigates with minimal rotation.

Usage:
    ./auto_scan.py [--speed 0.15] [--min-dist 0.35] [--duration 60]

Emergency Stop:
    - Press SPACE or 's' to immediately stop
    - Press 'r' to resume after stop
    - Press 'q' to quit
    - Press Ctrl+C to force quit
